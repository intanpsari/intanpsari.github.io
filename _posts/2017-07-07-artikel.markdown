# Why Study Javascript?
    1. HTML to define the content of web pages
    2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
    3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

Did You Know?
`JavaScript` and `Java` are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
`ECMA-262` is the official name of the standard. `ECMAScript` is the official name of the language.

You can read more about the different JavaScript versions in the chapter [JS Versions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_versions.asp).
